## Getting Started using TestDrive

This sketch is a bare basics template for getting started with TestDrive Arduino. From here you can add your own sensor libraries, and start sending data to your dashboard.

## Installation Instructions
* Upload the sketch to your Arduino (Tested using Arduino Uno)
* You should see the TX light flash around 4 times per second, which means data is being sent via USB Serial.
